# Terraforming Mars

Terraforming Mars is a game by Jacob Fryxelius. In Terraforming Mars, you control a corporation, and you buy and play cards describing diî€Ÿerent projects.

The projects often directly or indirectly contribute to the terraforming process, but can also consist of business enterprises of different kinds. In order to win, you have to accumulate a good terraform rating (TR) and many victory
points (VPs). Your TR is increased each time you raise a global parameter (temperature, oxygen or ocean).

The following features have being left out deliveratively from implementation from the original game:
- Awards

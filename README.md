# Terraforming Mars

Terraforming Mars is a game by Jacob Fryxelius. In Terraforming Mars, you control a corporation, and you buy and play cards describing different projects.

The projects often directly or indirectly contribute to the terraforming process, but can also consist of business enterprises of different kinds. In order to win, you have to accumulate a good terraform rating (TR) and many victory
points (VPs). Your TR is increased each time you raise a global parameter (temperature, oxygen or ocean).

## This implementation

This implementation of Terraforming Mars is implemented using OOP in Typescript as part of Object Oriented Programming course.

## Out of Scope

The following features have being deliveratively left out from implementation from the original game:

- Editing other's players production values
- Top level requirements
- Awards
- Milestones
- Complete list of Cards
- Corporation selection for players
- Tags

## Example Implementation and Concepts

To exemplify the usage of different OOP concepts, the following list was compiled:

Basic elements:

- [x] Destructuring - "./players" Line 55
- [x] For...of Loops "./terraform" Line 42
- [] For...in Loops

Usage of data structures:

- [] Stack
- [] LinkedList

Usage of elements:

- [] Static Types
- [] Construction and deconstructing
- [] Types: for Lightweight data
- [] Classes
  ○ Single Responsibility Principle
  ○ Dependency
- [] Class inheritance
- [] Class implementations
- [] Interfaces
- [] Usage of private and not exportable methods

Usage of advanced elements:

- [] Polymorphic
- [] Function overloading

Usage of idiomatic features>

- []

Usage of Design Patterns:

- [] Façade: data management.
- [] Factory Patter
- [] State Patter
- [] Builder Patter
- [] Fluint

Usage of principles and concepts:

- [] SOLID

Organization:

- [] Single folder
- [] Different files and good usage of expot
- [] Index.ts

Extra Points:

- [] Recursion

Documentation:

- [] Add one line per method
- [] Except terribly basic (1-2 lines of code)

Style:

- [] Usage of TSList

Readme

- [] Usage of TypeScript and explain how to run it

Specific:

- [] Game show data
- [] Prevent illegal actions!
- [] Readonly
- [] Basic Types, Obect Literal,
- [] Don't use classes for small things
- [] Usage of static types
- [] Basic structure types to be more specific with input parameters.
